== Description ==

Subscription Stock Manager helps manage WooCommerce subscriptions backed by underlying products with stock.

It adds support to subscriptions to ensure that on renewal, a subscription with underlying products with stock can either be automatically placed on hold if the underlying products are out of stock, or a subscription renewal only charges for products that are in stock.
